# POC-FlashcardGenerator
a quick proof of concept for generating flashcards from text input

just storing this on github, but I will be rewriting this in the future in another language to generate flashcards into a database for a flashcard app

currently just takes in some text input, outputs the word and the definitions from https://googledictionary.freecollocation.com
